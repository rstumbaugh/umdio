#An API for UMD data 

Status: We are live at [umd.io](http://umd.io)

To use the API, check out the [docs](http://umd.io).

Why umdio? Check out the [blog post](http://robcobb.me/2015/04/14/why-umdio.html). In short, we want to make university data more accessible for developers, who will make awesome tools and projects. In turn, school is better for everyone.
