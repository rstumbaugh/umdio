<p>This endpoint lets you get data about bus routes, schedules, stops, locations, and predicted arrival times. The data is provided by <a href="http://www.dots.umd.edu/nextbus.html">NextBus</a>, which monitors buses and gives the data to us via their <a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/nextbus/api/nextbus-api">API</a>. We think our API is easier to use, but our data might be behind NextBus by a few seconds. If your app requires to-the-second bus location info, you can go right to the source.</p>
